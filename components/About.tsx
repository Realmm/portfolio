          I began my development journey creating Minecraft plugins, I
          thoroughly enjoy modifying Minecraft and pushing the game to its
          limits. I have been modifying Minecraft for 6+ years, utilising
          Java/Kotlin, Maven/Gradle, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kubernetes, Docker,
          as well as NMS.

          I spent my first 3-4 years of my development life freelancing,
          creating Minecraft plugins for many clients, and with varying
          different types of features.

          I have worked creating content for PrestonPlayz and BriannaPlayz on
          YouTube, with some of the videos I have helped create being trending
          on YouTube with millions of views.

          I have also worked creating minigames for Twitch Rivals for close to a
          year, wherein 80 popular streamers, with thousands of viewers, would
          compete in $50,000+ tournaments.
        </span>

        <br />

          I have also worked with many medium-large Minecraft networks as well,

          I touched on creating sites many times throughout my 6 years of
          developing, however I have never worked creating sites in a
          professional capacity.

          To do this I use technologies such as React, Typescript, Next.js,
          TailwindCSS. I am predominantly a front-end developer, however I
          prefer backend development. I have used Spring and Spring Boot in the
          past to create simple REST APIâ€™s, however most often I utilise Next.js
          built in api routes to accomodate my backend needs.
